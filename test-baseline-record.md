## Performance Baseline (Before Improvements)
- **Date**: 2025-07-01T17:09:26+02:00 
- **Total Tests**: 490 tests
- **Test Results**: 82 failed | 406 passed | 2 skipped
- **Duration**: 117.94s
- **Test Files**: 16 failed | 14 passed | 1 skipped (31 total)

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Database Connection Issues
- Many tests skip due to "no test database available" despite successful database setup
- Inconsistent state where setup logs show success but tests detect no connection
- Tests using `process.env.SKIP_DB_TESTS === 'true'` fallback mechanism

### 2. Container Management Redundancy
- `run-tests.sh` starts containers once for entire suite
- `test/setup.ts` has individual test file database provisioning logic
- Potential conflicts between global and per-test-file container management

### 3. Performance Concerns
- Total test duration: 117.94s
- Multiple database resets and migrations occurring
- Container startup time included in test execution

## Current Test Infrastructure Architecture

### Global Setup (run-tests.sh)
- Starts docker-compose containers once
- Waits for database readiness
- Runs all tests via `npm test`
- Cleans up containers on exit

### Per-Test-File Setup (setup.ts)
- Individual database provisioning checks
- Database reset between test suites
- Migration execution per test file
- Fallback to mock storage on failure

## Failing Test Categories
- Database-dependent tests with connection issues
- CAMT import tests (all skipped due to DB connection)
- Some UI component tests with React warnings
- Transfer verification tests (skipped)

## Medium Priority TODO Improvements Completed (2025-07-01)
