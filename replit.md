# FIRE Budget Application - Personal Finance Management System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive personal finance management application focused on the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) methodology. The system helps users track accounts, categorize transactions, set financial goals, and receive intelligent transfer recommendations to optimize their financial journey toward independence.

The application is built as a full-stack web application with a React frontend and Express.js backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence and featuring automated CAMT.053 bank statement processing.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

## Data Flow

1. **Statement Import**: Users upload CAMT.053 XML files
2. **Data Parsing**: System extracts account and transaction information
3. **Account Discovery**: New accounts are automatically detected and created
4. **Transaction Categorization**: ML algorithms suggest expense categories
5. **FIRE Calculations**: System computes savings rates and financial metrics
6. **Transfer Optimization**: Algorithm generates money movement recommendations
7. **User Review**: Users can accept, modify, or reject automated suggestions

## External Dependencies

### Core Infrastructure

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 with Replit hosting
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 managed instance
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Process Management**: tsx for TypeScript execution

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite production build to static assets
- **Backend**: esbuild bundling with ESM output
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations for schema management
- **Deployment**: Replit autoscale deployment target

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL for database connection
- **Build Scripts**: Separate development and production workflows
- **Asset Management**: Public asset serving with Express static middleware
