# Test Infrastructure Review - Senior QA Engineer TODOs

## Executive Summary
Performance optimizations successfully reduced test execution time from 117+ seconds to 1-5 seconds through centralized container management and intelligent database operations. Review identifies 8 key areas for future improvement focusing on reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

## HIGH PRIORITY TODOs

### 1. Database Connection Pool Management ⚠️
- [ ] Implement connection lease tracking with automatic cleanup after test completion
- [ ] Add connection pool monitoring with metrics collection

- [ ] **Risk**: Connection leaks, resource exhaustion, test interdependencies

### 2. Test Data Isolation Strategy ⚠️  
- [ ] Implement database transaction-based isolation using BEGIN/ROLLBACK per test
- [ ] Add unique test data namespacing (e.g., test_run_id prefixes)
- [ ] Create test-specific database schemas or use separate database instances
- [ ] Implement row-level locking for critical test operations
- [ ] **Risk**: Race conditions, test interference, data corruption
