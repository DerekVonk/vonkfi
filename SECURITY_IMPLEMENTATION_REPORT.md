# Security Implementation Report

## Overview
This report documents the comprehensive security improvements implemented in the VonkFi application to address vulnerabilities identified in the `auth-security.test.ts` file.

## Security Issues Addressed

### 1. Password Security ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Passwords were stored in plaintext in the database.

**Implementation**:
- **Password Hashing**: Implemented bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **Password Strength Validation**: Added comprehensive validation requiring:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
  - Rejection of common passwords
- **Secure Password Management**: Added password rehashing for improved security over time

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `server/utils/passwordSecurity.ts` - Core password security utilities
- `server/storage.ts` - Updated user creation and authentication methods
- `test/password-security.test.ts` - Comprehensive password security tests

### 2. Input Validation and SQL Injection Protection ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Insufficient input validation could lead to SQL injection attacks.

**Implementation**:
- **Enhanced Validation Middleware**: Extended existing Zod-based validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries use parameterized queries through Drizzle ORM
- **Input Sanitization**: Added comprehensive input sanitization for XSS prevention
- **File Upload Security**: Enhanced file validation with size limits, type checking, and content validation

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `server/middleware/validation.ts` - Enhanced validation middleware
- `server/validation/schemas.ts` - Comprehensive validation schemas

### 3. Rate Limiting ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: No rate limiting protection against DoS attacks.

**Implementation**:
- **Advanced Rate Limiting**: Implemented sophisticated rate limiting with:
  - IP and User-Agent based tracking
  - Multiple rate limit tiers for different operations
  - Exponential backoff for failed requests
  - Memory cleanup for expired entries
- **Specialized Rate Limiters**:
  - General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes
  - Authentication: 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes
  - File Upload: 10 uploads per hour
  - Intensive Operations: 3 operations per hour

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `server/middleware/rateLimiting.ts` - Advanced rate limiting implementation

### 4. Session Management ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: No session management system was implemented.

**Implementation**:
- **Secure Session Configuration**:
  - HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS
  - Secure cookies in production
  - SameSite strict for CSRF protection
  - Session expiration (24 hours)
  - Custom session name
- **Authentication Middleware**:
  - `requireAuth` - Requires valid authentication
  - `requireUserAccess` - Ensures users can only access their own data
  - `optionalAuth` - Populates user info if available
- **Session Security Features**:
  - Session regeneration on login to prevent fixation
  - Session validation against user existence
  - Proper session destruction on logout

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `server/middleware/authentication.ts` - Complete authentication system
- `server/routes/auth.ts` - Authentication routes (login, register, logout, etc.)

### 5. Error Handling and Information Disclosure ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Error messages could leak sensitive information.

**Implementation**:
- **Information Sanitization**: Comprehensive error message sanitization:
  - Removes passwords, tokens, secrets, connection strings
  - Sanitizes file paths and database details
  - Prevents exposure of internal system information
- **Environment-Specific Handling**:
  - Production: Generic error messages only
  - Development: Detailed but sanitized error information
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging without exposing to clients
- **Error Classification**: Proper HTTP status codes and error categorization

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `server/middleware/errorHandler.ts` - Enhanced error handling with sanitization

### 6. File Upload Security ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: File uploads lacked proper security controls.

**Implementation**:
- **File Size Limits**: 10MB maximum file size
- **MIME Type Validation**: Only XML files allowed for CAMT imports
- **Content Validation**: XML structure validation
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: File name sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: Specialized upload rate limiting

**Files Modified**:
- `server/middleware/validation.ts` - Enhanced file upload validation

### 7. API Authorization ✅ COMPLETED
**Issue**: API endpoints lacked proper user authorization checks.

**Implementation**:
- **Comprehensive Authorization**: Added authentication and authorization to all user-specific endpoints:
  - Dashboard data access
  - Account management
  - Transaction operations
  - Goal management
  - Transfer operations
  - Import functionality
- **User Data Isolation**: Ensures users can only access their own data
- **Role-Based Access**: Proper access control implementation

**Files Modified**:
- `server/routes.ts` - Added authentication and authorization to all endpoints

### 8. Additional Security Enhancements ✅ COMPLETED

**Security Headers**:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (production only)

**CSRF Protection**:
- CSRF token generation and validation
- Protection for state-changing operations
